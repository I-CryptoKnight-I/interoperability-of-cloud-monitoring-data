# InteroperabilityOfCloudMonitoringData

Cloud computing enables the provision of services in a scalable and on-demand fashion. Current practices for efficient Cloud service provisioning management are based on monitoring. Monitoring generates the real-time data regarding the state of the Cloud infrastructures and deployed services. These data are crucial for gaining insight and making decisions. Due to the emergence of numerous monitoring tools for managing heterogeneous Cloud platforms, the generated monitoring data are formatted using diverse and mostly incompatible data interchange formats. This results to lack of interoperability and makes the analysis of monitoring data from multi-Cloud service deployments difficult to handle.

Objectives The aim of this project is to implement a platform-independent and efficient data interchange format for serializing and structuring Cloud monitoring data to enable interoperability and easy management of multi-Cloud service deployment. The implemented data interchange format will be integrated with our existing monitoring system to evaluate its performance in our OpenStack Cloud platform.

Requirements This project requires: •	Knowledge of Java programming language •	Interest in Cloud monitoring research •	Interest in working with OpenStack Cloud platform

Expected Outcomes The expected outcomes at the end of the project includes: •	A report on the survey of data interchange formats applied in Clouds •	A prototype of the proposed and implemented data interchange format •	Evaluation reports
