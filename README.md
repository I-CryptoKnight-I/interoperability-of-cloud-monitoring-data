# InteroperabilityOfCloudMonitoringData


Cloud computing enables the provision of services in a scalable and on-demand fashion. Current practices for efficient Cloud service provisioning management are based on monitoring. Monitoring generates the real-time data regarding the state of the Cloud infrastructures and deployed services. These data are crucial for gaining insight and making decisions. Due to the emergences of numerous monitoring tools for managing heterogeneous Cloud platforms, the generated monitoring data are formatted using diverse and mostly incompatible data interchange formats. This results to lack of interoperability and makes the analysis of monitoring data from multi-Cloud service deployments difficult to handle.
